## ‚úÖ Notes
- The Gold Layer is built as **SQL Views** referencing Silver Layer tables.  
- **Surrogate keys** (`ROW_NUMBER()`) are used in dimensions for analytics efficiency.  
- **Data joins** integrate CRM and ERP sources for unified customer and product insights.  
- The **fact_sales** table enables slicing by both product and customer dimensions.
