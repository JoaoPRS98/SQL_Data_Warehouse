# SQL_Data_Warehouse
This project focuses on building a small Data Warehouse in SQL Server, modeled in a Star Schema (fact and dimension tables) to practice advanced SQL and data modeling.  The goal is to apply Data Engineering fundamentals, from schema design to writing optimized queries, while documenting the entire process.
