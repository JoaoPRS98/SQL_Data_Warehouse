ðŸ“¦ Data Warehouse in SQL Server â€“ Star Schema

	This repository documents the construction of a small Data Warehouse in SQL Server, developed as part of my Data Engineering learning roadmap (Month 1 â€“ Advanced SQL + Data Modeling).

	The main goal is to practice data modeling and advanced SQL, by implementing a Star Schema and writing optimized queries for data analysis.





ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

	Create and structure a Data Warehouse in SQL Server.

	Model the data using a Star Schema (fact and dimension tables).

	Write advanced and efficient SQL queries for analysis.

	Document the entire process of design, implementation, and optimization.



ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

	/sql â†’ SQL scripts (table creation, data insertion, queries).

	/docs â†’ Diagrams and data model documentation.



ðŸ”§ Stack

	SQL Server

	Data modeling tools (e.g., dbdiagram.io, Draw.io or similar).
